Hi, I'm Saul (/sɔːl/) **Samuels Moselle**. (NB: My surname is double-barreled and does not contain a hyphen!) 

I'm a future trainee solicitor at [Herbert Smith Freehills](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/), due to start in September 2026. 

Before that I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, where I did MML with a focus on linguistics, including an interest in computational linguistics and NLP. 

You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saul-samuels-moselle/).
